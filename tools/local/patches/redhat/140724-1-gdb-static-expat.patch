This patch causes the expat library (which implements XML parsing) to
be linked statically with GDB.  TI requested this so that GDB binaries
can be used on other linux distributions with less hassle.

On my Fedora 20 machine, I needed to do the following to install
the static expat library:

yum install expat-static

This patch should NOT be submitted upstream.
