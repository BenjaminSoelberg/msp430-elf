Post Installation
-----------------
If installer is intructed to update the system search path, the tools will
be immediately available for use upon the next reboot or system login.  
One might, for instance, select "Run..." from the Start Menu and type
"bash" for the program to run.  This will bring up a command window using
the familiar Unix shell.  Commands such as gcc, gdb, and so forth will
be immediately available.
