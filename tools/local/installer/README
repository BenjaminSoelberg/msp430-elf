Installation
------------

Unix
----
To install the tools from the shell prompt, run install-gui.  Users of HPUX
systems with the 8.3 filename convention limitation should run insthpux.sh.

Unix Post Installation
----------------------
Once the tools are installed, the executables will be available in
PREFIX/RELEASE/H-*/bin, where * is the host triplet installed and
PREFIX is the install time selection used (normally /opt/redhat).  As
an example, a Solaris 2.7 system using the default prefix would have
a new path of /opt/redhat/RELEASE/H-sparc-sun-solaris2.7/bin.

Windows
-------
To install the tools from Windows Explorer, open the CDROM folder and
double-click on the "install.gui.bat" or "install~1.bat". Follow the
directions in the installer.

To install the tools from the Command prompt, change to the CDROM drive
and run "install-gui.bat" or "instal~1.bat"

Windows Post Installation
-------------------------
If installer is intructed to update the system search path, the tools will
be immediately available for use upon the next reboot or system login.  
One might, for instance, select "Run..." from the Start Menu and type
"bash" for the program to run.  This will bring up a command window using
the familiar Unix shell.  Commands such as gcc, gdb, and so forth will
be immediately available.
