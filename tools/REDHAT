  It represents a fundamental shift in how software is created.  The
  code that makes up the software is available to anyone.  Developers
  who use the software are free to improve the software.  The result
  is rapid innovation.

  support you need to meet your business objectives.  Red Hat is 
  intimately familiar with this software from extensive experience
  using, debugging, and implementing it.  You get direct access to the 
  most qualified support people: the authors of the software.
